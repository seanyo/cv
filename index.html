    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <div class="community">
        <p>In 2007 <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/atguelph/07-02-14/news.shtml" >I was part of the inaugural team</a> of volunteers at the University of Guelph to participate in <a href="http://www.uniterra.ca/uniterra/en/leave_for_change/how_to_get_involved.html" >Leave For Change</a>. I went on a three week short-term volunteer placement in Kathmandu, Nepal where I worked with the Fair Trade Group Nepal. I focused on building organizational capacity by training their staff and their member organizations on HTML development and delivered a strategic web plan for their organization. I was honoured to be invited to speak at the <a href="http://sean.onleave.ca/women-in-ict-presentation/" >Women in Information and Communication Technology Group</a> while I was in Kathmandu.</p>
        <p>In 2009 <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/president/blog/2009/07/global_citizenship.php#more" >I traveled with my father to Indonesia</a>, where he was born. As part of this trip, I was able to volunteer with the Agape Social Foundation, a non-profit group which provides funding for children to attend school and runs a learning centre and children's library. The foundation is run by my family; I was able to once again focus on increasing their capacity by delivering IT and Web Development training to the teaching staff of the Agape Social Foundation. I was once again honoured to be invited to speak, this time at the <a href="http://sean.onleave.ca/visit-to-mm-univeristy/" >Universitas Muhamadiyah Malang</a>. I presented to their IT Staff, at their request reviewed their new campus website and had a meeting with the University President.</p>

        <p>These opportunities have profoundly affected my values and vision. The opportunity of the Internet and the Web has tremendous promise. Closing the Digital Divide and enabling everyone who wishes it to connect through the Web is a project that could take a lifetime to achieve. And that sounds like a pretty great life to me.</p>
